## Description
{This is a website that gives users a good impression of how Eva's Restaurant looks and feels like. The website displays the food and drinks offering and should has the following capabilities.
1.) Has Hover effect for the 'breakfast, lunch and dinner' sections such that oh hover they are covered by a layer of white as shown by the lunch section and their fonts are turned to black from white.
2.)The Hamburger menu represented by the 3 horizontal lines(On small Screen) when clicked should open a full screen menu that has the following menu items: a.contacts b.events c.menu but leads no where.(hyperlink to #)
3.)All the three sides with different lengths. This is called a scalene triangle.
It is important to note, you can have a triangle is one side is larger than the sum of the other two sides.

This application will use Java Script to analyse the input provided by the user and give an output. Being a web app, we shall use a HTML for mark up and CSS for styling. }
## Setup/Installation Requirements
{This is a Web Application developed on HTML, CSS and Java Script. All you need to run is a browser and internet. However, if you have the code locally, it can run on your computer browser.}
## Behavior Driven Development(BDD)
{Before writing this code, I focused first on the behaviours that I would want to see in our final application. I considered what the program should do, thought through possible scenarios when the user would encounter when interacting with the application. I considered how the application will handle input of other characters instead of numbers (intergers) or no value at all. 

Therefore, I developed an application that will take three values as lengths of a triangle and give a response to the user what type of the triangle do the values makes. If the values can not make a triangle, the application gives a response; that is not a triangle. }
## Known Bugs
{Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know? Outline any issues that would impact use of your application. Share any workarounds that are in place. }
## Technologies Used
{I have used HTML for mark up, CSS for Styling and Java Script to code the function of comparing the values inputted and outputing results as per the description.}
## Support and contact details
{It is unlikely that you run into any issues as you use the application. But incase you do, please drop me an email at mr.mwaniki@gmail.com.
